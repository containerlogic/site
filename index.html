          <h2>Cloud Native Operation Framework</h2>
          <p>
            Years of dedicated effort have gone into developing a comprehensive and robust operation framework with core
            modules essential to every cloud-native infrastructure setup. Our framework enables clients to effortlessly
            adopt the latest technologies and rapidly expand while prioritizing security and reliability. We follow a
            set of critical practices when implementing our cloud-native operation framework to ensure optimal results
            for our clients.

              <h4><a href="#services">Modularity & Versioning</a></h4>
              <p>
                Promoting reusability, we develop top-quality, versioned automation modules with a high level of
                abstraction. This enables engineers to customize the platform to different use cases in various
                environments.

              <h4><a href="#services">Operations as Code</a></h4>
              <p>
                Our approach involves building Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with dynamic modules while implementing
                security, policy, and SDN networking as code. This enables engineers to reuse components and experiment
                with various configurations in a reproducible manner, promoting greater flexibility and agility.

              <h4><a href="#services">Metrics & Observability</a></h4>
              <p>
                Distributed systems can be challenging to understand, which is why emitting metrics and implementing
                observability and monitoring are crucial and treated as first-class features. This approach enables us
                to make data-driven decisions and gain a comprehensive understanding of system behavior.

              <p>
                The public cloud offers the potential to deploy clusters worldwide, spanning various accounts, regions,
                or namespaces. Therefore, having an operations framework that enables engineers to reuse the same
                building blocks across diverse organizational structures is paramount and can have a significant impact
                on real-world distributed systems operations.

              <p>
                Our approach streamlines delivery pipelines and infrastructure operations directly from Git
                repositories. This approach allows engineers to make pull requests and accelerates and simplifies both
                service deployments and Kubernetes operations, while also eliminating configuration drifts through
                reconciliation loops.

                The relatively new Operator Pattern aims to embed operational knowledge into software. By integrating
                natively with Kubernetes concepts and APIs, Operators automate common Day-1 (installation,
                configuration, etc.) and Day-2 (re-configuration, update, backup, failover, restore, etc.) activities in
                a piece of software running inside your Kubernetes cluster.

                  Alaa established most of our infrastructure on Kubernetes, He worked closely with developers and made
                  it easy to deploy
                  and scale services up and down. He also implemented an observability stack on all services. Alaa
                  showed good
                  communication with his coworkers. He did a great job building a step-by-step roadmap explaining the
                  phases for
                  developing the infrastructure. This was particularly useful since we were working in different time
                  zones. He also
                  presented easy-to-understand demos and wrote good infrastructure documentation. I think Alaa is
                  thoughtful and caring
                  about people, he always did his best to make the team understand his ideas. We enjoyed working with

                  I had the privilege to learn and work with alaa for at least 6 months and the experience is great!
                  Alaa is a exceptionally skillfull SRE, always keep up with latest best practices and happy to share
                  his wisdom. His deep
                  knowledge in infrastructure, distributed system and observability help us build abstraction and
                  automation on top of our
                  complex setup. Within a few weeks he manage to build a scalable yet reliable framework for
                  infrastructure team to build
                  on and effectively reduce operational costs from weeks to hours. On top of this he manages to keep the
                  documentations up
                  to date for others to follow.
                  I highly recommend Alaa for anyone looking to build robust distributed infrastructure. I personally am
                  looking forward
                  to work with him again, I certainly hope our path crossed again one day.

                  able to run thousands of docker based units.
