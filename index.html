          <h2>Cloud Native Operation Framework</h2>
          <p>
            We have been working hard for years to develop a comprehensive and powerful operation framework with
            built-in core modules needed by every cloud native infrastructure setup. The purpose of this framework is to
            help our clients adopt the latest technologies and be able to expand quickly to gain competitive advantage
            with security and reliability in mind. We focus on a set of important practices when we implement the cloud
            native operation framework for our clients.

              <p>
                Not only do we build IaC (Infrastructure as Code) with dynamic modules, we also implement security,
                policy and SDN networking as code. This allows engineers to reuse components and experiment different
                configurations in a reproducible way.

              <p>
                Distributed systems are hard to reason about, therefore, emitting metrics and implementing observability
                and monitoring is very important and should be treated as first-class features. This also helps us make
                data-driven decisions

                Public Cloud provides the ability to deploy clusters worldwide, across different accounts, regions or
                namespaces. Having an operation framework that allows engineers to reuse the same building across
                different organization structures is extremely important and has a huge impact on real life distributed
                systems operations.

                  Alaa established most of our infrastructure on Kubernetes, He worked closely with developers and made
                  it easy to deploy
                  and scale services up and down. He also implemented an observability stack on all services. Alaa
                  showed good
                  communication with his coworkers. He did a great job building a step-by-step roadmap explaining the
                  phases for
                  developing the infrastructure. This was particularly useful since we were working in different time
                  zones. He also
                  presented easy-to-understand demos and wrote good infrastructure documentation. I think Alaa is
                  thoughtful and caring
                  about people, he always did his best to make the team understand his ideas. We enjoyed working with

                  Alaa is a exceptionally skillfull SRE, always keep up with latest best practices and happy to share

                  complex setup. Within a few weeks he manage to build a scalable yet reliable framework for
                  infrastructure team to build
                  on and effectively reduce operational costs from weeks to hours. On top of this he manages to keep the
                  documentations up
                  to date for others to follow.
                  I highly recommend Alaa for anyone looking to build robust distributed infrastructure. I personally am
                  looking forward
